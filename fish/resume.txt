my graude project wasnt a normal architectre, i had a chance to work on a very rare project, a project that was collpasing due to worng engineering, a confidentail projct and a team of nobel professors was trying to keep the building up. it was a unique experience and it wasnt the only project i involved with this circumustances, it seems, i enjoy solving complex problem, and usualy i had to deal with a such conditin, there wasnt of course reward for fixing sometihng that had to be planned corecly in the beignig, but for me those projec was a lotof insight, that many people doesnt have a chance to gain.i agree each project have its own challenges and mistakes can happen, but its important how signifacnt it is,,,,
