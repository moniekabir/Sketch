with the rise of computers, she slowly find her infinite interests into computer games, because no npcs ask you about your gender, nor their care, and computers start to replace every thing in her life,
however it was more like a children trying without a teacher


for the non tehcnchal reader, to know that i have integrated some of the phiolosohphy of machine learning and quantum computing and number theory into the heart of my narrative using my metformic language, but it should be straight forward.


i also like to mention about the diversity i bring, beside my experince in architectural desing and planning, manegerial presties (dicipiline), my gender secifc views, is unique to my kind, as its not possible for someone to learn them, without having the condition


my father was a phisicans, he spend most of his life helping other people, where ever they was a patient and other time supporting people lifes, while he never mentioned, but i could say, looking at gifts he was recieving from ordinaries nad instutation. yeah, and life didnt let him enjoy retiremnt an dhe passed just about a few weeks after.
and i left with the idea, that what if i knew a way that could help people like him, who did the most contribution into ours, to have more time to spend fo themselves. and obvousely it was a time/space complexity problem and a quantom ...

as a designer, it was my hope, to bring a better experience, 


an architectural design, was always treatet as art methodlogy, and to many people it still is. but its very dependent on the designer prefrences, i was always a scientifc designer, to me understanding the relation between a milimiter of an space
was even important. how to laying down, every pieces together, understading the futre of the building, and the futer trend or regression line, how to build for a large audience without having an standard as indivusal have diffrent styles. the material used 
the energy effiecney of the buidling, the position of the sun, how light could effictvely consult on anxiety, diffrent elements in the people home, how to avoiod hoarding disroder, it was an architectural problem or it was a natural cuase. air pultuion
and how to effectively isolate an house from , another important issue was the obsseion cuased by the thing of healthy enviroment, even the relationship between the lines could have diffrent concequences on indivusal life, but this, espcially if we comibe them into a design, arent just simple geometry or artistic problem,
they are reletviley massive computation problem, with also a time complxity, during years after year,s my observation creted many question to me, how could possible one knows , all of these diffrent science that has their foundation in physiscs, chemsity math matchis, biology, how could one make a proper desion without having a learning in all of those areas, and een that was possible
how could someone model such a complex problem, wasnt possible using any logic, even depending on current machine learning problem, or quanumo computing, wasnt the complete solution, we also have to know a way to answer the problems we dont know an answer yet, and we all aware how machine learn, by example of problems we already solved, so these are not simple problems, they are not a business problem
they are foundational problems, and i think machine learning, and can be just an starting point for me, and not a complete solution, to address such problems, but its not the only things im looking for, obviousely, our observation was revealed other areas. okay, so the reveloutiany dates after civil war two, give an intution how mechinacial solids with the help of conventional computers can help us do the things hard for humans
but if an eggs can be turn itno a chicken, its only a matter of time for someone to figure it out, how we can build such a bilogical mechinical systems, that can report on their own, when there is a problem, that's my long term goal, to find a way to build a biological mechnaism, and perhaps then we can start to thinkig even biggern in science fiction.'


having those problem in my mind, i was studying hourse of understanding these in my spare time, i was always searching for computer science, looking into the reationship of machines and phyiscal matters, what makes us comofrotable, what makes us ask questions, may of groud finding in science was accdeintal events, lead to a great discvory, is that the case? or something else supply our curosity, and slowley i found that all of my studies are whole around the science mostly the computations
that made those science, i was noticing an arhcitect isnt isnt a creator, in best of our effort was was applying sciences, it was math, the computer science was made eevry thing a possibility, .....

other problem such as work efifeceny, how we could...


so my hope is to develop a knoledege during my studies ad working with iffrent people in an academic envrioment help me to find solution or get intution for my next move in order to solve,
such problems, problems that that are not in the main interest of businesses, because they cant drectly measure those core values, but those problems are center of all other problems, solving them
means solving every thing else... 

and i haven't been just thinking about those things, i was developing my knoledege, and i have educated my self i nabout 4000 horuse of academic learning using online coruses, further developed a general intake path, and i have a plan, anad its not possible before i can finish higher level of education with a highly qualifed university, in order to save a world...


In my research statment, attahcment no xx, i have explained what kind of problems i am currently interested in, further my career goal is to find solution to build biological machines, i thnik every thing as a system, for instance, it doesnt matter if a system is living, for example, weather is a system, it can be built, ....
im not talking about stories like Frankenstein, i think it as if a system isnt more than a serious functions, and workers that can read instructions, so thats us, any kind of system isnt impossible ...
