the purpose of learning model is to solve one of the biggest challenges of the humanity and industry, wich is learning curve and motivation, learning curve is aim to change learning curve into a linear fashion and add motivation														
because we (i mean others) doesnt understand the learning model, thats how they end up creatigng bad long courses,  with a vey expensive time/year cost and a lotof hidden cost to world cost														
so they also endup creating bad application and worth than that they are really bad at IA, which isnt a simple topic, IA deals with a very complex math problems														
wich in return cant be usually undesratand with out us nonbinaries being involved, ( let me mention why we nonbinraies are good at this, because we naturally live i nsuper position, untill we are measured)														
we are alos natrualy able to solve the optimal path problems														
so i am going to introudce the map model, wich can solve many problems with learning curves, but this is only the starting point														
a map model is a visual representation of infrastructure pipelines, that also had brief, large description , simple , comprehensive example, and applications embeded into system.														
the purpose of map model is to follow learning model, so we can maximize learning, whille minimizing cost (time/year) learning rate , what ever you call it!														
maybe the first map model i produce is to explain GCP, so in order this will remove many many of the shit coruses google have created, because they ciricum developers are not evend heared of learning model!!														
														
map model is also backward compatible, it let us when developing the learning model, to backward and see , what are unnsessary context and can be removed from applciation softwares, and or piplines.														
														
it is also comptible with chronicle object/math models. hw ever they are very complicatd, and are only appear when we iterate over current cloud/ml architectures, and then we applied reduction or merge branching into our system														
wich help us finally achieve math model, the ultimate goal of data manipulation!														
														
well this ideas inhereted from the solar system, not humans, as we can see, our system doesnt require our invovlement, its a complete atuomatic pipeline, and we as its users get what we want from the pool, no more action is required														
even from a security concept, atleast not now!														
														
														
chronicle will also address hiring problem, its obvious that in the future we dont have any human interaction than resourcee managment model combined with ranking and cost, which is a safe replacement of current project base managment model														
with resourse managmenet hrining and interview and all other expensive (again expensive its only means time/year cost) investement will be gone for good, resource managment is automated, independent and optimal managmenet system that alocate														
human resoruces automaticaly to specifc problem. its main aim is to remove burnadries, and lock with companies, and add higher level of freedom to our socicety as a whole, no government, no border, nothing will be involved,														
and it will automatically remove the waterfall (or top down rankingsystem) desion makers are become granial and happens at the real expertise and observation level, not by guesses done by todays desion makers, who created a dirty world.!!!
