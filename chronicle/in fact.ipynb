    "i think there is a nice correlation with integer factorization and natural branching and centraliziation, you know\n",
    "that's the problem, because its easy branching and its even clear in if model, but the fact that its hard to aggregate those all information is because we dont know how to factor this information, i dont know it might odesnt make sense\n",
    "but i know that how this numbers work give us a lotof new inforamtion, maybe our interaction with analysis\n",
    "we might learn how to effictively merge branches we create i saw it in machine learning\n",
    "the fact that llm are susscefull is that we aggregate and merged a huge data together, so then this transfare learning doesnt letus improve it the natural way, it still goes as rebranching, but if we dont merge them agian we havent learn new things as we should\n",
    "\n",
    "so that means how smart we are doesnt matter, i learned it from iq tests, and machine learnings\n",
    "actually we are not able to solve patterns we never seens before, and thats doesnt mean we are not smart\n",
    "we are only doesnt smart if that doesnt hurt us and we dont look for unknown\n",
    "it might be really hard to understand a pattern we dont recognize but if we open the question and keep it in our mind\n",
    "we will finally able to solve the problem, the reason for that is , doesnt matter how we try if we dont know a problem\n",
    "and we doesnt have data that help us to solve the problem we are in a false iteration, we never get the answer\n",
    "it only works if we gather new information, and if and only if we gather the right information we are able to solve the problem\n",
    "and i think thats the case with factorization problem\n",
    "i am so wondered why such a simple problem remained unsolved for all of these years, the answer was clear actually i discussed it above\n",
    "but there is one more things, right information, we might now massive math information, but they are not going to work with if, the reason is if is a simple aggregation and matrix problem, and it comes from two dimension, but it also need you to have a really good undesrtanding of many others topic that are nessessary not math, so then you might be able to solve it"

    "It's time! Previously, we discussed integer factorization. The obvious are factors of the 2 and 3, so I skip those. Our intuition would be about numbers of the forms \"6n + 1\" and \"6n -1\", more precisely first of the two. It is more convenient to ask you for some test cases first. Please provide at least five random numbers generated from the 6n + 1 and have at least a magnitude of 16 (in fact, it can be any arbitrary length), and I will find their factors in no time, provided they are not prime. or you can read for yourself from the following image."
