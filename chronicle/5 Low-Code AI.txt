In essence,
everything the customer “touches” as a data point should be
tracked and captured as a data source.

The nature of the decision you must make is tied directly to the
data you will need to gather to make that decision - which
needs to be formulated into a problem statement.

Historical data is
typically referred to as batch, whereas real-time data capture is
typically called streaming.

It is important to note that any
question that may arise in analyzing data can be grouped in
one of five ML categories ?

Because most ML models are trained
using data from files, storing your data in a cloud storage bucket
makes for easy data collection. Cloud storage buckets can be
used for storing both structured and unstructured data.

It is possible to have streaming structured data. Structured vs unstructured is a
property of data format. Streaming vs batch is a property of latency.

once a model is deployed as an application and it begins
collecting data, new data enters the pipeline that may skew the
original model’s results. (At this point you enter the fascinating
realm of Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps, which is
beyond the scope of the book.)
