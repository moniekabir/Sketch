Therefore, to summarize the training algorithm first, we initialize the weights and biases to random values. Then, we iteratively repeat the following steps 1. Calculate the network output using forward propagation. 2. Calculate the error between the ground truth and the estimated or predicted output of the network. 3. Update the weights and the biases through backpropagation. Repeat the above three steps until the number of iterations or epochs is reached or the error between the ground truth and the predicted output is below a predefined threshold.
